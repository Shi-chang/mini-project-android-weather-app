# Overview
<p>This is a weather application using Android and Java. </p>
<p>Every time the user inputs a city name and clicks the search button, the app will send a request to https://openweathermap.org/ with the city name and the developer's API key to fetch the geographic information(latitude and longitude) of the city. The information will then be sent again to the website to fetch response data containing the weather information of the location provided. It then parses the response data, retrieves useful information including weather condition and temperatures, and updates the weather information on the container. </p>

# What I have learned
1. Making http requests with Java and parsing the response data with org.json.* package in Java.
2. More practice with Android components such as Buttons, TextViews, and RecyclerView.

# My contribution to the project
1. Making http requests and parsing the response data.
2. Refractoring other team members' code.
3. Writting the documentation for the majority of the project.
